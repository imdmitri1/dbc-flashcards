User story:
 As a user, I visit the homepage and see a list of decks. I click on the name of a deck and play a round with that deck. After the round, I see stats on how well I performed. If I've logged in, I can then visit my profile to see stats for all the rounds I've played.

Round description: After a user selects a deck, they play a round. We have specific requirements for what should happen when a user plays a round.

The user plays every card in the deck.
The cards are played in a random order.
For each card, the user is shown a prompt and responds by submitting a guess.
After submitting a guess, the user is informed whether or not the guess was correct and shown the correct answer.
The round continues until each card is answered correctlyâ€”after going through each card, cards answered incorrectly will be displayed again.
Round statistics description: After a user completes a round, the user should be shown statistics for the round. We have specific requirements for what statistics should be displayed.

Name of the deck played.
The number of cards answered correctly on the first guess compared to the number of cards in the deck.
Total number of guesses made.
Profile description: Registered users should have a profile page that showcases their flashcard history.

Statistics for all rounds played should be available.
Statistics should be organized by deck and displayed in chronological order.
For each round, required details are the date the round was played, the number of cards in the deck, the number of cards answered correctly on the first guess, and the total number of guesses needed to complete the round.
